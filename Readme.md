# Crop Prediction

This project aims to predict the best crops to plant based on various environmental factors such as soil type, weather conditions, and historical crop yield data.


## Introduction
Crop prediction is essential for optimizing agricultural productivity. This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze environmental data and provide recommendations for the most suitable crops to the farmer.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Crop recommendation based on input parameters
- Visualization of prediction results

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Steps Involved in the project
Used Streamlit application for presenting the results of the machine learning model. Initially we have created a machine learning model in the 'main.ipynb' file. The machine learning is a neural network with Relu activation layer in input, hidden layers and softmax activation layer for the output.
